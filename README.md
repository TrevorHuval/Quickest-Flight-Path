# Quickest-Flight-Path
Given two airports, calculates the quickest flight path by time from a list of airports and flights using Dijkstra's Algorithm in C++
Note: This project was done in the fall of 2020, and I'm just getting to uploading it to github now. I've done a bit of modification to it to make it more user friendly
Added: Typing 'help' displays the list of airports | Now can run program indefinitely without having to pass inputs as commandline arguments
